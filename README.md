    Hi there! Iâ€™m D Ther Htun from Yangon, Myanmar. Currently, I am running Kubernetes User Group Myanmar and Organizer at AWS User Group Myanmar mostly sharing knowledge among the community about the cloud, micro-services, DevOps topics. I love to talk about golang, Kubernetes, Infrastructure As Code with Terraform, and containers technology. Spent 6 years developing the skills to increase velocity, reliability, and quality for System, DevOps, and Platform Engineer with a high focus on cloud-native infrastructure. Deep experience with Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, helping organizations instill DevOps for the modern age.
